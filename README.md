🎓 Task 3: College Event Feedback Analysis – Internship Project

📖 Project Overview
This project analyzes student event feedback to uncover satisfaction trends and suggest improvements using survey data.  
The dataset includes student demographics, feedback text, ratings, and event details.  
The goal is to perform *sentiment analysis* and generate insights that can help improve future college events.


🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- *Python* (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, TextBlob, VADER)  
- *Google Colab / VS Code (Jupyter Notebooks)*  
- *WordCloud* for visualization  
- *CSV survey data*  


📊 Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values, standardized text.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – explored age, gender, ratings distribution.  
3. **Sentiment Analysis** – applied `TextBlob` & `VADER` for polarity & subjectivity.  
4. **Visualization**  
   - Word Cloud of most common feedback  
   - Sentiment distribution pie chart  
   - Feedback rating analysis  
5. **Insights** – identified positive/negative trends and areas of improvement.  


📈 Key Insights
- Majority feedback was **positive**, but ~30% of responses showed **negative sentiment**.  
- Common concerns included *organization, management, and crowding*.
